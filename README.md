## Overview

Github PM is a personal and user friendly analytics platform created to explore the activity of any GitHub repository in a precise and insightful way.  
The dashboard presents real data from live repositories and gives a clear understanding of development progress, collaboration patterns and contributor performance.  
Everything happens directly from the browser and without any local setup. Simply paste the link of a repository and the platform does the rest.

Live version available here  
https://gam-soft-pm.streamlit.app/

## What the platform offers

### Repository overview

A complete view of the selected repository including  
• active branch versus default branch  
• project description and metadata  
• language statistics  
• stars, forks and watchers  
• number of open and closed issues  
• number of open and closed pull requests  
• creation date and last push date  
• chart with the weekly activity pattern  
• clean card based layout with professional styling

### Branch specific author analytics

The platform isolates the activity of each contributor on the selected branch.  
This gives a clear understanding of who worked on what and when, with accurate filtering that excludes commits inherited from the default branch.

Displayed information includes  
• total number of commits  
• first recorded contribution  
• most recent contribution  
• days of activity  
• total lines added and removed  
• net contribution volume  
• files touched for each commit  
• daily activity trend  
• sortable commit history table  

### Author 360 degree view

Each contributor has a dedicated analysis page that showcases  
• detailed commit based diff information  
• charts showing additions, removals and overall contribution shape  
• daily activity timeline  
• complete list of files changed per commit  
• dynamic HTML report that can be downloaded in one click  

This view is especially useful for project reviews, audit documentation and understanding development flow at an individual level.

### HTML report generator

Every author page provides a downloadable HTML report that includes  
• repository info  
• author summary  
• charts  
• commit details  
• project branding  

It is formatted exactly like the live version and is ready to store, share or attach to documentation.

## Roadmap

The following enhancements are planned to further improve the platform

### Soon
• multi repository dashboard  
• personal activity summary across all repositories  
• configurable color themes  
• compact mobile layout  
• repository tagging and categorization  

### Later
• comparison view between branches  
• contribution heat maps  
• comment and review analysis  
• pull request quality indicators  
• optional PDF report export when browser engines support full canvas rendering  

### Future vision
• team level productivity modelling  
• anomaly detection for unusual development patterns  
• smart insights powered by local AI models  
• integration with GitHub projects and GitHub actions

## LinkedIn announcement text

I am excited to share Github PM, a personal platform I created to explore GitHub repositories with a modern and intuitive dashboard.

It gives a complete view of project activity including  
• branch level analytics  
• contributor insights  
• detailed commit exploration  
• interactive charts  
• downloadable HTML reports  

Everything works directly from the browser. You just paste the repository link and the platform analyzes it in real time.

Building this helped me reimagine how repository insights can be visualized and how development patterns can be understood in a clearer and more structured way.  
More improvements and features are coming soon.
